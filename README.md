# Legacy Web Application Reverse Engineer

This project is designed to reverse engineer a legacy web application to retrieve user data and the currently authenticated user's details. It utilizes TypeScript for type safety and clarity.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tesseractdev12/legacy-webapp-reverse-engineering.git
cd legacy-webapp-reverse-engineering
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will execute the script, which fetches the user data and writes the results to `users.json`.
